# Tunnelbar SSH Tunnel Manager Configuration
# Place this file at ~/.config/tunnelbar/config.yaml
#
# Each server entry specifies an SSH host and ports to forward.
# The host value should work with `ssh <host>` directly — configure
# authentication, jump hosts, etc. in your ~/.ssh/config.
#
# - port: the remote port to forward
# - local_port: (optional) the local port to bind; defaults to same as port
